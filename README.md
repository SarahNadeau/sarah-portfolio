An example of my recent coding work.

Hello! This directory is intended to give you a snapshot of some of my current projects through code and visualization. I have included my resume to give you a broader picture of who I am and what I've been up to.

alaska_dn_gene_visualization is a working visual of results from a functional denitrification gene study performed on metagenomic samples from alaskan forest soils.

cnn_taxonomy_classification is my novel application of a triplet-loss convolutional neural network. The ultimate goal of this project is to identify the most related organisms in a reference set to unknown metagenomic reads, and to provide a distance metric for these taxonomic "neighbors".

fastqc_cutadapt_workflow is an example of how I document data cleaning. This specific example involves using the opensource tools fastqc (https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) and cutadapt (http://journal.embnet.org/index.php/embnetjournal/article/view/200/479) to remove sequencing adapters from read data.
