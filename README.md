Examples of my coding work.

This directory is intended to give a snapshot of some of my projects through code and visualization, as of Spring 2018.

alaska_dn_gene_visualization is a visualization script from a functional denitrification gene study performed on metagenomic samples from alaskan forest soils.

cnn_taxonomy_classification is from a masters-course project where I used a triplet-loss convolutional neural network to identify the most related organisms in a reference set to unknown metagenomic reads, and to provide a distance metric for these taxonomic "neighbors".

fastqc_cutadapt_workflow is an example of data cleaning using the tools fastqc (https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) and cutadapt (http://journal.embnet.org/index.php/embnetjournal/article/view/200/479) to remove sequencing adapters from read data.
